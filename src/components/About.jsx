        <p className="text-[18px] leading-relaxed">
          I'm a passionate and confident MERN stack developer with a strong
          foundation in building full-stack web applications using React,
          Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My programming journey started with a
          curiosity for how websites work, which quickly grew into a love for
          solving real-world problems through code.
          <br />
          <br />
          I enjoy working on responsive, user-friendly websites, especially
          projects where I can combine beautiful frontend design with powerful
          backend functionality. I love challenges that push me to learn new
          technologies and build scalable, efficient solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of coding, I'm interested in creative design, enjoy learning
          about new technologies, and like spending my free time exploring art
          and photography. Whether it's debugging code or sketching ideas, I
          believe creativity drives both my technical and personal life.
